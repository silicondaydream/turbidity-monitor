## Components
- `elegoo Uno R3` - main controller.
- `0.96 Inch OLED Module IIC I2C` - 124x64 pixel self-luminous display.
- `RGB LED indicator` - provides color coded status.
- `9v battery` - power supply.
- `9v battery holder with switch` - houses battery and controls on/off function.
- `custom 3D printed screen mount` - Not pictured.
- `custom 3D printed enclosure` - Not pictured.

## Tools Used
- OnShape: 3D design program
- Cura: Slicer program
- Ender 3 v2 PRO: Printer
- Platform IO (VS Code IDE)


### Software Recommendations
- OnShape: Free modeling software I use.
- Cura: My slicer of choice.
- VS Code: IDE for programming

### Material Recommendations
- PLA: Basic filament.
- PLA+: For stronger product needs.
- Elegoo controller board (cheaper Arduino dupe)

## Usage
This project is intended for individuals with insecure and potentially harmful liquid material sources. THis is a cheap basic turbitity monitor for standard readouts.
